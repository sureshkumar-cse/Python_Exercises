# Problem Statement: "Given a sorted array of integers, and an integer x, find the first index of the array containing the number x, or return -1 in case the number doesn't appear in the array".

# Solution:

# Binary Search on a sorted Array
def solution(a, x):
    l = 0
    r = len(a) - 1
    while l <= r:
        m = (l + r) // 2
        if a[m] == x:
            return m
        elif a[m] < x:
            l = m + 1
        else:
            r = m - 1
    return -1
